<section>
There are <span style="font-family:verdana;font-weight:bold">alot</span> of people who argue kombucha does not have any health benefits.<br>

<h2> Where to go from here?</h2>
<span style="color:red">Just to recap, as long as you make sure that your brew stays at a contant 92&nbsp.5&#176;, for the entire brewing process</span><br>
the alcohol content of your brew will be negligible.
